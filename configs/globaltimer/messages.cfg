// Here you can customize timer messages.

// Variables:
//   - {prefix}   The tag displayed in front of all timer related commands/messages.
//   - main       What's displayed as a replacement for {track} when the track was main.
//   - bonus      What's displayed as a replacement for {track} when the track was bonus.

// Messages:
//   - sr         Displayed when a player beats the server record for their style. (Note: displayed separate from pb/firstpb,
//                so there's no need to show time related stuff here, unless that's intentional)
//   - firstpb    Displayed when a player finishes the map for the first time / doesn't have a previous pb.
//   - pb         Displayed when a player beats their pb.
//   - finish     Displayed when a player finishes the map, but doesn't beat their pb.

// Substitutions:
//   - {prefix}   Timer title. Default: [GlobalTimer]
//   - {name}     Steam name.
//   - {time}     Time it took to complete the track. (HH:MM:SS.MS)
//   - {oldpb}    Player's previous best time. (HH:MM:SS.MS)
//   - {pb}       Player's best time. (HH:MM:SS.MS)
//   - {dif}      Difference between pb and most recent time. (HH:MM:SS.MS)
//   - {track}    Track the run occurred on. (Main/Bonus)

// Notes:
//   - {oldpb} only gets updated if a player beats their pb, so if you display it in "finish", it will just show 0.000s.
//   - {dif} isn't positive or negative, so you'll have to include a "+" or "-" when needed.
//   - All variables use the same color tags as messages.
