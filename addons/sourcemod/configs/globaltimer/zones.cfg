// Config for zone textures

// Notes:
//   - "model" is the path to the texture in the user's materials folder. Generally this should be the same as "path" but
//     without the "materials/" in front of it. Also needs to include the ".vmt" at the end of the file.
//   - "path" is the path to the texture files from /csgo/ in the server directory. Both files (.vtf and .vmt) need to be
//     named the same for it to work. Also don't put any file extension at the end of this, since the plugin will add the
//     needed extension when needed.
