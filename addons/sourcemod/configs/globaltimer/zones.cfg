// Config for zone textures

// Variables:
//   - model     Path to texture file in the user's materials folder. In general, this should be the same as "path", but without
//               "materials/" in front of it. Also needs to include ".vmt" at the end.
//   - path      Path to texture file on the server, starting from the /csgo/ folder. Both ".vmt" and ".vtf" files need to be named the same.
//               Also don't put any file extensions, since the plugin will add the extension when needed.
//   - speed     Speed the texture will scroll at. (0 will make it not scroll at all)
//   - width     Width of beam.
//   - color     RGB value for zone color (each value separated with spaces).
